# Question 1
# 1. Go to Project Gutenberg (http://gutenberg.org) and download your favorite
# out-of-copyright book in plain text format. Modify your program from the
# previous exercise to read the book you downloaded, skip over the header
# information at the beginning of the file, and process the rest of the words 
# as before. 
#
# Then modify the program to count the total number of words in the book, and 
# the number of times each word is used.
# 
# Print the number of different words used in the book. Compare different books 
# by different authors, written in different eras. Which author uses the most 
# extensive vocabulary?
