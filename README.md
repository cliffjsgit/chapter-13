Start by cloning the Chapter 12 Exercises into you local repository.

 $ cd ~

Once you have cloned this repo, you may proceed to the labs.

 $ cd ~/chapter-13
 ~/chapter-13 (master)$ ls

Create a solutions directory for your exercise solutions, in the chapter-12 directory.

 ~/chapter-13 (master)$ mkdir solutions
Copy all of your final/completed chapter-9 lab exercise solutions from all exercise problems, and the words.txt file into the solutions directory.

 ~/chapter-13 (master)$ cp exercise*  solutions/ 
 ~/chapter-13 (master)$ cp words.txt  solutions/
 ~/chapter-13 (master)$ cp emma.txt  solutions/
 ...
Make sure that you copy all of your completed exercise solutions and the words.txt file from this chapter
