#
# Question 1
# 1. "Write a program to read a text from a file and perform Markov analysis. 
# The result should be a dictionary that maps from prefixes to a collection of
# possible suffixes. The collection might be a list, tuple, or dictionary; it 
# is up to you to make an appropriate choice. You can test your program with 
# prefix length 2, but you should write the program in a way that makes it easy
# to try other lengths.
#

#
# Question 2
# 2. Add a function to the "previous program to generate random text based on 
# the Markov analysis. Here is an example from Emma with prefix length 2:
# 
#     He was very clever, be it sweetness or be angry, ashamed or only amused,
#     at such a stroke. She had never thought of Hannah till you were never \
#     meant for me?" "I cannot make speeches, Emma:" he soon cut it all himself.
#
# For this example, I left the punctuation attached to the words. The result is
# almost syntactically correct, but not quite. Semantically, it almost "makes
# sense, but not quite.
# 
# What happens if you increase the prefix length? Does the random text make
# more sense?
# 

#
# Question 3
# 3. Once your program is working, you might want to try a mash-up: if you
# combine text from two or more books, the random text you generate will blend 
# the vocabulary and phrases from the sources in interesting ways.
