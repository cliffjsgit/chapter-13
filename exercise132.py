# Exercise 13.2
#
#
# Grading Guidelines:
# - No answer variable is needed. Grading script will call function.
# - Function "strip_and_lower" should return a histogram in the form of a
# dictionary where the key is the word and the value is the number of times
# it occured.
#
# 1. Modify your function from the previous exercise to skip over the header 
# information at the beginning of the file, and process the rest of the words 
# as before. Then modify the function to count the total number of words in 
# the book, and the number of times each word is used. Use a histogram to
# collect this info and return that dictionary -- where the key is the word 
# and the value is the number of times it occured.
